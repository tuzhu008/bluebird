<p>This page describes parallels of using promises in other languages. Promises as a pattern are very common in other languages and knowing what they map to in other languages might help you with grasping them conceptually</p>

<h2 id="c">C#</h2>

<p>A promise is similar to a C# <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code>. They both represent the result of an operation.</p>

<p>A promise’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">then</code> method is similar to a Task’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">ContinueWith</code> method in that both allow attaching a continuation to the promise. Bluebird’s <a href=".">Promise.coroutine</a> is analogous to C#’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">async/await</code> syntax.</p>

<p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">TaskCompletionSource</code> is analogous to the promise constructor. Although usually promisification is preferred (see the API reference or working with callbacks section).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.FromResult</code> is analogous to <a href=".">Promise.resolve</a>.</p>

<p>The difference between a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> and a promise are that a task might not be started and might require a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.Start</code> call where a promise always represents an already started operation.</p>

<p>In addition promises are always unwrapped. A promise implicitly has <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.Unwrap</code> called on it - that is, promises perform recursive assimilation of promises within them.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26136389/how-can-i-realize-pattern-promise-deffered">this question on StackOverflow</a> for more differences.</p>

<p>##Scala</p>

<p>A bluebird promise is similar to a Scala <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future</code>. A scala <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise</code> is similar to how the promise constructor can be used (previously, to a bluebird Deferred).</p>

<p>Just like a future, a promise represents a value over time. The value can resolve to either a fulfilled (ok completion) or rejected (error completion) state.</p>

<p>Where blocking on a Future in scala is discouraged, in JavaScript it’s downright impossible.</p>

<p>In addition promises are always unwrapped. That is, promises perform recursive assimilation of promises within them. You can’t have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise&lt;Promise&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> where a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future[Future[T]]</code> is valid in Scala.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22724883/js-deferred-promise-future-compared-to-functional-languages-like-scala">this question on StackOverflow</a> for more differences.</p>

<p>##Python</p>

<p>A promise is similar to a Twisted Deferred object. In fact the first JavaScript implementations of promises were based on it. However, the APIs have diverged since. The mental model is still very similar.</p>

<p>A promise is <em>not</em> similar to a Python <code class="highlighter-rouge">concurrent.Future</code> which does not chain actions.</p>

<p>Asyncio coroutines are similar to bluebird coroutines in what they let you do, however bluebird coroutines also enable functional-style chaining.</p>

<p>##C++</p>

<p>A bluebird promise is similar to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::future</code> and the promise constructor is similar to an <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::promise</code> although it should rarely be used in practice (see the promisification section).</p>

<p>However, a bluebird promise is more powerful than the current implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::future</code> since while chaining has been discussed it is not yet implemented. Promises can be chained together.</p>

<p>Boost futures expose a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.then</code> method similar to promises and allow this functionality.</p>

<p>##Haskell</p>

<p>A promise is a monadic construct with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.then</code> filling the role of <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;=</code> (bind). The major difference is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.then</code> performs recursive assimilation which acts like a <code class="highlighter-rouge">flatMap</code> or a map. The type signature of <code class="highlighter-rouge">then</code> is quote complicated. If we omit the error argument and not throw - it’s similar to:</p>

<div class="language-hs highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kr">then</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="kt">Promise</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Either</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Promise</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Promise</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is, you can return either a promise <em>or a plain value</em> from a <code class="highlighter-rouge">then</code> without wrapping it.</p>

<p>Promises perform a role similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">IO</code> in that they allow for easy chaining of asynchronous non-blocking operations. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise.coroutine</code> can be seen as similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">do</code> notation although in practice it’s not an accurate comparison.</p>

<p>##Java</p>

<p>A promise is similar to a guava <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">chain</code> being similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">then</code>.</p>

<p>If your’e familiar with Java 8 lambdas, you can think of a promise as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Future</code> you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> to another future.</p>

<p>##Android Java</p>

<p>Several popular Android libraries use promises - for example the Parse Java API returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code>s which are similar to JavaScript promises.</p>

<p>##Objective-C</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with PromiseKit, it is based on a same specification bluebird is based on so the API should feel familiar right away.</p>

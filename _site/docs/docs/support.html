<p>Depending on the nature of your problem there are a few possible ways of getting help with your problem.</p>

<p>###Stack Overflow</p>

<p>Stack Overflow has an active community answering questions on both the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluebird">bluebird</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/promise">promise</a> tags. If you are unfamiliar with Stack Overflow, do review <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking">the asking guidelines</a> before asking a new question there.</p>

<p>###Google Groups mailing list</p>

<p>The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bluebird-js">bluebird-js@googlegroups.com</a> mailing list is the best place to ask any question that cannot be easily fit in the stack overflow question format.</p>

<p>###IRC</p>

<p>You can usually get fast answers on the freenode.net channels <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/bluebird">#bluebird</a> and <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/promises">#promises</a>.</p>

<p>###Gitter</p>

<p>If you are not comfortable using IRC you can also join the <a href="https://gitter.im/petkaantonov/bluebird">bluebird gitter chat</a></p>

<p>###Github issue tracker</p>

<p>If you feel that your problem is caused by a bug or a missing feature that should be added, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues/">Github issue tracker</a> to report it. However in any other case the issue tracker is not the appropriate channel.</p>
